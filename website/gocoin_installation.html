<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>System requirements</h2>

If you only want to use the <b>wallet</b> with the corresponding <b>balio</b> tool, 
you can run it on anything that your <b>go</b> compiler can build for.<br>
For instance, it will work on even the oldest Raspberry Pi model A with 256MB of RAM.
<br><br>

However, in order to run the full node (<b>client</b>), you need a 64-bit OS with at least 15 GB of RAM.<br>
You also need a file system that supports large files (bigger than 4GB) and a decent size of a free space on it.<br>
<br>
Note that you can purge blocks from disk, allowing you to run the node with a limited storage (e.g. 20GB).<br>
See <a href="gocoin_manual_config.html">config file</a> values:
<span class="cfg_name">Memory.MaxDataFileMB</span> and <span class="cfg_name">Memory.DataFilesKeep</span> (set this one to non-zero, e.g. 10)<br>
<br>
The node runs very well on Linux based virtual servers, as long as they have enough RAM.<br>
Find below a list of example providers. Some of them you can rent per-hour.<br>

<h2>Build from source</h2>

You will need <b>git</b> and <b>go</b> commands installed in your system and in most cases
(not for Windows) also <b>gcc</b> (e.g. <code>sudo apt-get install gcc</code>)<br>
<br>
Once you are ready with that, simply execute <code>go get github.com/piotrnar/gocoin</code> to download all the sources and dependencies.<br>
<i>&nbsp;Note: Sources will be placed within your GOPATH folder, in <code>scr/github.com/piotrnar/gocoin</code>.<br>
&nbsp;Note: Execute <code>go env GOPATH</code> to see where your GOPATH folder is.</i><br>
<br>
Then go to <code>gocoin/client/</code> and execute <code>go build</code> there.
Do the same in <code>gocoin/wallet/</code>, to build the wallet. <br>
In order to build <code>balio</code> or some other tool, go to <code>gocoin/tools/</code> and do <code>go build balio.go</code><br>
<br>

The process is also described in the main <b>README.md</b> file of the github repo

<h2>Binaries</h2>
